This Python script will run in the background monitoring some of your system statistics: CPU usage, disk space, available memory and name resolution. Moreover, this Python script should send an email if there are problems, such as:

Report an error if CPU usage is over 80%

Report an error if available disk space is lower than 20%

Report an error if available memory is less than 100MB

Report an error if the hostname "localhost" cannot be resolved to "127.0.0.1"

Import the necessary Python libraries (eg. shutil, psutil) to write this script.

Complete the script to check the system statistics every 60 seconds, and in event of any issues detected among the ones mentioned above, an email should be sent with the following content:

From: automation@example.com

To: student@example.com

Subject line:

Case

Subject line

CPU usage is over 80%

Error - CPU usage is over 80%

Available disk space is lower than 20%

Error - Available disk space is less than 20%

available memory is less than 100MB

Error - Available memory is less than 100MB

hostname "localhost" cannot be resolved to "127.0.0.1"

Error - localhost cannot be resolved to 127.0.0.1

E-mail Body: Please check your system and resolve the issue as soon as possible.

Note: There is no attachment file here, so you must be careful while defining the generate_email() method in the emails.py script or you can create a separate generate_error_report() method for handling non-attachment email.

``` python

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import shutil
import psutil
import socket
import emails
import os

sender = "automation@example.com"
receiver = "<USERNAME>@example.com".format(os.environ.get('USER'))
body = "Please check your system and resolve the issue as soon as possible."

# Checks disk usage and sends email if available space < 20%
du = shutil.disk_usage("/")
du_prsnt = du.free/du.total * 100
if du_prsnt < 20:
    subject = "Error - Available disk space is less than 20%"
    message = emails.generate_error_email(sender, receiver, subject, body)
    emails.send_email(message)

# Checks CPU usage and sends email if usage >80%
cpu_prsnt = psutil.cpu_percent(1)
if cpu_prsnt > 80:
    subject = "Error - CPU usage is over 80%"
    message = emails.generate_error_email(sender, receiver, subject, body)
    emails.send_email(message)

# Checks for available memory, if < 100mb sends an email
mem = psutil.virtual_memory()
trs = 100 * 1024 * 1024  # 100MB
if mem.available < trs:
    subject = "Error - Available memory is less than 100MB"
    message = emails.generate_error_email(sender, receiver, subject, body)
    emails.send_email(message)

# Checks hostname and if cannot be resolved to "127.0.0.1" sends an email
hostname = socket.gethostbyname('localhost')
if hostname != '127.0.0.1':
    subject = "Error - localhost cannot be resolved to 127.0.0.1"
    message = emails.generate_error_email(sender, receiver, subject, body)
    emails.send_email(message)
