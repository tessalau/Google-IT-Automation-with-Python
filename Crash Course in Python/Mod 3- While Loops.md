Question 3

The following code contains an infinite loop, meaning the Python interpreter does not know when to exit the loop once the task is complete. To solve the problem, you will need to:

Find the error in the code

Fix the while loop so there is an exit condition

Hint: Try running your function with the number 0 as the input and observe the result.

Note that Coursera’s code blocks will time out after 5 seconds of running an infinite loop. If you get this timeout error message, it means the infinite loop has not been fixed. 
``` python
def is_power_of_two(number):
  # This while loop checks if the "number" can be divided by two
  # without leaving a remainder. How can you change the while loop to
  # avoid a Python ZeroDivisionError?
  while number!=0 and number % 2 == 0:
    number = number / 2
  # If after dividing by 2 "number" equals 1, then "number" is a power
  # of 2.
  if number == 1:
    return True
  return False
  
# Calls to the function
print(is_power_of_two(0)) # Should be False
print(is_power_of_two(1)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of_two(8)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of_two(9)) # Should be False
```

Question 4

Write a function that takes an argument n and returns the sum of integers from 1 to n. For example, if n=5, your function should add up 1+2+3+4+5 and return 15. If n is less than 1, just return 0. Use a while loop to calculate this sum.
``` python
def sum_of_integers(n):
  if n < 1:
    return 0


  i = 1
  sum = 0
  while i<=n:
    sum = sum + i
    i = i+1


  return sum


print(sum_of_integers(3))  # should print 6
print(sum_of_integers(4))  # should print 10
print(sum_of_integers(5))  # should print 15
```

Question 5

Fill in the blanks to complete the function, which should output a multiplication table. The function accepts a variable “number” through its parameters. This “number” variable should be multiplied by the numbers 1 through 5, and printed in a format similar to “1x6=6” (“number” x “multiplier” = “result”). The code should also limit the “result” to not exceed 25. To satisfy these conditions, you will need to:

Initialize the “multiplier" variable with the starting value

Complete the while loop condition

Add an exit point for the loop

Increment the “multiplier" variable inside the while loop
``` python
def multiplication_table(number):
    # Initialize the appropriate variable
    multiplier = 1


    # Complete the while loop condition.
    while multiplier<6:
        result = number * multiplier 
        if  result > 25:
            break# Enter the action to take if the result > 25
            ___
        print(str(number) + "x" + str(multiplier) + "=" + str(result))
        
        # Increment the appropriate variable
        multiplier += 1




multiplication_table(3) 
# Should print: 
# 3x1=3 
# 3x2=6 
# 3x3=9 
# 3x4=12 
# 3x5=15


multiplication_table(5) 
# Should print: 
# 5x1=5
# 5x2=10
# 5x3=15
# 5x4=20
# 5x5=25


multiplication_table(8) 
# Should print:
# 8x1=8
# 8x2=16
# 8x3=24
```
