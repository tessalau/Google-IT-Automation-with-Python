Question 3

Fill in the blanks to make the is_power_of function return whether the number is a power of the given base. Note: base is assumed to be a positive number. Tip: for functions that return a boolean value, you can return the result of a comparison.
``` python
def is_power_of(number, base):
    # Base case: when number is smaller than base
    if number < base:
        # If number is equal to 1, it's a power (base**0).
        return number == 1  # Corrected to return a Boolean instead of 1

    # Recursive case: keep dividing number by base.
    return is_power_of(number / base, base)


print(is_power_of(8,2))     # Should be True
print(is_power_of(64,4))    # Should be True
print(is_power_of(70,10))   # Should be False
```
Question 4

Recursion is a process where a function calls itself one or more times with modified values to accomplish a task. This technique can be particularly effective when solving complex problems that can be broken down into smaller, simpler problems of the same type. In the provided code, the count_users function uses recursion to count the number of users that belong to a group within a company's system. It does this by iterating through each member of a group, and if a member is another group, it recursively calls count_users to count the users within that subgroup. However, there is a bug in the code! Can you spot the problem and fix it?
``` python
def count_users(group):
    count = 0
    for member in get_members(group):
        if is_group(member):
            count += count_users(member)  # Recursively count users in subgroups
        else:
            count += 1  # Count users only (not groups)
    return count



print(count_users("sales")) # Should be 3
print(count_users("engineering")) # Should be 8
print(count_users("everyone")) # Should be 18
```
Question 5

In the while loops practice quiz, you were asked to write a function to calculate the sum of all positive numbers between 1 and n. Rewrite the function using recursion instead of a while loop. Remember that when n is less than 1, the function should return 0 as the answer.
``` python
def sum_positive_numbers(n):
    if n < 1:
        return 0
    return n+sum_positive_numbers(n-1)


print(sum_positive_numbers(3)) # Should be 6
print(sum_positive_numbers(5)) # Should be 15
