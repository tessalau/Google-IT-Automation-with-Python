This code is supposed to display the equation 2 + 2 = 4 on the screen, but there is an error. Find the error in the code and fix it, so that the output displays the equation.

Note: Make sure the spaces between the components in your equation are identical to the spaces in the equation provided in the question. 
``` python
print("2 + 2 = " + str(2 + 2))
```
Question 2

In this scenario, two friends are eating dinner at a restaurant. The bill comes in the amount of 47.28 dollars. The friends decide to split the bill evenly between them, after adding 15% tip for the service. Calculate the tip, the total amount to pay, and each friend's share, then output a message saying "Each person needs to pay: " followed by the resulting number.
``` python
bill = 47.28 # Assign "bill" variable with bill amount
tip = bill * 0.15 # Multiply by stated tip rate 
total = bill + tip # Sum the "total" of the "bill" and "tip"
share = total/2 # Divide "total" by number of friends dining
print("Each person needs to pay " + str(share)) # Enter the required string and "share" 
# Hint: Remember to convert incompatible data types

```

Question 3

This code is supposed to take two numbers, divide one by another so that the result is equal to 1, and display the result on the screen. Unfortunately, there is an error in the code. Find the error and fix it, so that the output is correct.
``` python
numerator = 10
denominator = 10
result = numerator / denominator
print(result)
``` 
Question 4

Combine the variables to display the sentence "How do you like Python so far?" 
``` python
word1 = "How"
word2 = "do"
word3 = "you"
word4 = "like"
word5 = "Python"
word6 = "so"
word7 = "far?"

print(word1+" "+word2+" "+word3+" "+word4+" "+word5+" "+word6+" "+word7)
