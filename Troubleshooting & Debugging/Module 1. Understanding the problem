1. The compare_strings function is supposed to compare just the alphanumeric content of two strings, ignoring upper vs lower case and punctuation. But something is not working. Fill in the code to try to find the problems, then fix the problems. Your goal is to search for the character “-” but - is typically reserved for ranges. Find a work-around that enables you to compare the two strings.
```python
import re
def compare_strings(string1, string2):
 try:
    #Convert both strings to lowercase
   #and remove leading and trailing blanks
   string1 = string1.lower().strip()
   string2 = string2.lower().strip()


 #Ignore punctuation
   punctuation = r"[.?!,;:\-']" # re.error: bad character range :-' at position 6




   string1 = re.sub(punctuation, r"", string1)
   string2 = re.sub(punctuation, r"", string2)
  


   return string1 == string2

 #DEBUG CODE GOES HERE

 except re.error as e:
      print(f"Regex Error: {e}")  # Catches regex-related errors
      return False

 except Exception as e:
      print("Failure to send email: {}".format(e), file=sys.stderr)
   


print(compare_strings("Have a Great Day!", "Have a great day?")) # True
print(compare_strings("It's raining again.", "its raining, again")) # True
print(compare_strings("Learn to count: 1, 2, 3.", "Learn to count: one, two, three.")) # False
print(compare_strings("They found some body.", "They found somebody.")) # False
```
